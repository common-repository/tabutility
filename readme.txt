Get the attention back on your tab!

Don't let your site get suffocated among the user's open browser tabs:- 

Animate your site's tab after a preset time and then present them with a special offer when they return.

== Description ==
Make your site stand out by regaining the user's attention.

With this plugin, the title and icon on any Wordpress page can be made to animate after a period of inactivity.  Once the page is returned to, a special offer is automatically presented to the user.

The animation speed, page name changes, and icons to be used are all fully configurable.  Stick with the default settings, or design your own attractive animation method that best suits your site.

When the plugin detects the user has returned to your site, hit them with a custom special offer overlay.  Use the simple setup page to choose the colors, fonts, text, and graphics that you think best complements the offer - or redirect them immediately to any page of your choice.

Simple and effective marketing with full support provided.
